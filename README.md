# Transcode files in a directory

This script takes a directory as input and recursively finds and then transcodes video files. The transcode uses settings which should be optimal for my setup i.e. a Raspberry Pi streaming content to a Google TV on a 1080p screen. The server used to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 but I will upgrade to a Raspberry Pi 5 (which has support for HEVC), at which point I'll use this scrip to transcode my library.
